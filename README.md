# ABCJS-Minimal-Editor-Notation-Player
A very simple web app based on [abcjs](https://github.com/paulrosen/abcjs) that loads local ABC (.abc) files,
displays the notation, and provides a player with looping and tempo adjustment.
Also, the ABC notation is editable in real time.

I built this to help me practice guitar for backing up celtic/contra tunes. The
advantages for me over the player provided on thesession.org are that
1. I can add chords of my choosing
2. I can adjust the tempo
3. Most importantly, I can loop the tune

I also use this for learning to play tunes by ear.

There are a few phone apps that would allow me to do most of this, except, 
unfortunately, they all use the integral android midi player. This player
creates a hesitation before loopping which is very annoying and distracting.
Paul Rosen's abcjs midi player does not do this!
